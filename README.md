Firejail is a SUID program that reduces the risk of security breaches by
restricting the running environment of untrusted applications using Linux
namespaces and seccomp-bpf.

This Ansible role allows you to setup and configure Firejail.

### Features

* Install Firejail from jessie-backports or other configured APT
  repositories. [debops.apt] can be used to enable Backports if needed.
* Sandbox programs system wide by placing a symlink to `firejail` into the
  ``PATH`` so that `firejail` can wrap program invocations and sandbox the
  invoked program using security profiles that Firejail ships or that the system
  administrator defines.

[debops.apt]: https://github.com/debops/ansible-apt

### Installation

This role requires at least Ansible `v2.1.3`. To install it, run:

```Shell
ansible-galaxy install debops-contrib.firejail
```
